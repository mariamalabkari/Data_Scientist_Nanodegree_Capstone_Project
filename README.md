### Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project was exploring the Starbuckâ€™s Dataset which simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.
It was driven by 4 main questions that were answered as the project came to its completion:
<ul>
  <li>What is the average income for Starbucks customers?</li>
  <li>What is the average age for Starbucks customers?</li>
  <li>What is the most common promotion?</li>
  <li>Which type of promotions each gender likes?</li>
</ul>
